            A read-only content API at <code>/api/v1</code>, authenticated with tokens rather than
            logins. The bundled admin and SPA are unchanged — this sits alongside them, so a blog
            can be served by the built-in frontend today and by a static site generator later
            without a rewrite.
          </p>
          <p className={`text-sm ${t.muted}`}>
            There is no <code>/api/v1</code> write surface. The admin API already has one, gated on
            roles, and a second path to the same mutations is a second place for an authorization
            bug to live.

            Issue one at <code>/admin/tokens</code>. The plaintext is shown once and never again —
            only a SHA-256 hash is stored, so a copy of the database does not hand over working
            credentials. Losing it means issuing another.
          </p>

            The <code>bb_</code> prefix is what lets one <code>Authorization: Bearer</code> header
            carry either a token or a user session — middleware picks the verifier from the prefix

            Every URL the content API returns is absolute, resolved against <code>APP_URL</code>.
            That matters more here than anywhere else in the app: the bundled frontend can resolve{' '}
            <code>/uploads/x.png</code> because it is served from the same origin, and a static
            build on another host cannot — it would emit markup pointing at its own server.
          </p>

          <p className={`text-sm ${t.muted} mb-4`}>
            With the default local driver the app serves those files itself, which works but puts
            every image request through your Node process. Object storage is the production answer,
            and <code>publicUrl</code> points the URLs at a CDN or custom domain rather than the
            bucket's own hostname.

            The API does not refuse to serve media when the local driver is active. Refusing would
            break the same-origin case, which is legitimate, and would tell a consumer nothing
            useful — an absolute URL at least resolves wherever the app is reachable. What it does
            instead is warn once at the first request if the URL is still relative, which means{' '}

            whose content is public anyway, and for letting a browser-side consumer read it without

            unverified, and keying on an unverified string hands an attacker a fresh budget per
            fabricated token. So the address it is. The limit is set high enough that sharing one
            rarely bites: a build fetching a thousand posts at the maximum hundred per page is ten
            requests.
